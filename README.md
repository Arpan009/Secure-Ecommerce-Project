A very simple web form I made as an assignment to revise the basic concepts of php and Database connection.

## insert.php
This is the first form displaying a product catalog

## product.php
This page processes the request from inseert.php. All the database connection as well insertion and dedletion code is in this file. The validations are also applied here as that was the requirement during this assignment.
